Instructions for preparing and running ASR performance tests:

1. In the "runtime" directory, run Ant.  This will result in two .amp files being built, located at runtime/build/dist.

2. Deploy runtime/build/dist/asrTestingModule-authoring.amp to an Alfresco WCM authoring server.

3. Deploy runtime/build/dist/asrTestingModule-asr.amp to an Alfresco ASR (on a separate Alfresco installation).
